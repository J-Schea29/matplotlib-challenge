# Observations
From my analysis of data on mouse tumor treatments I have drawn three take aways.

1.) Capomulin and Ramicane are more sucessful at reducing tumor size than any of there competetors. This maybe result of greater research already haven been done for these drugs given that they also have the highest measurments taken

2.) For the mouse b128, tumor treatment rapidly increased after the timepoint 25. This sugests that a certain amount of time is needed for sucessful treament.

3.) There is a strong correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight (.84 to be precise). This is clearly seen also with the points of the scatter plot gathered closly around linear regression line.
